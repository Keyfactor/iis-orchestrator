## Overview

The Windows Certificate Certificate Store Type, known by its short name 'WinCert,' enables the management of certificates within the Windows local machine certificate stores. This store type is a versatile option for general Windows certificate management and supports functionalities including inventory, add, remove, and reenrollment of certificates.

The store type represents the various certificate stores present on a Windows Server. Users can specify these stores by entering the correct store path. To get a complete list of available certificate stores, the PowerShell command `Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine` can be executed, providing the actual certificate store names needed for configuration.

### Key Features and Considerations

- **Functionality:** The WinCert store type supports essential certificate management tasks, such as inventorying existing certificates, adding new certificates, removing old ones, and reenrolling certificates.

- **Caveats:** It's important to ensure that the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is properly configured on the target server. The orchestrator relies on WinRM to perform its tasks, such as manipulating the Windows Certificate Stores. Misconfiguration of WinRM may lead to connection and permission issues.

- **Limitations:** Users should be aware that for this store type to function correctly, certain permissions are necessary. While some advanced users successfully use non-administrator accounts with specific permissions, it is officially supported only with Local Administrator permissions. Complexities with interactions between Group Policy, WinRM, User Account Control, and other environmental factors may impede operations if not properly configured.
